CAPSTONE
IntellectCoin
Learn2Earn

IntellectCoin is the app where you can learn as well as earn. This app is not only for students but for every person on the entire earth with minimal knowledge. This app will allow you to earn money with even basic knowledge. This app will be a bridge between company, organisation, etc and the people who are willing to earn and learn at same time. 

For example :
 I am a btech cse student of 1st year and I want to generate my own income but I just have knowledge of HTML,CSS. So as of now I will be unaware how to proceed further so this app will allow me to register with the skills that I know and I will have to provide artifacts and proofs regarding my learning. Similarly there may be company who require people with knowledge of HTML,CSS but don’t want to hire them so this company will register in the app and tell there requirements. If data from the student matches the company’s requirement we will get the match and the student can work with company for that particular duration with earning.

Problem Statement : 

People want to generate side income but are not getting time for part-time job or offline work. Many people are learning on daily basis such as  Btech students, UPSC students etc. For their earning without disturbing their earning this app is being prepared. Another reason is companies also need people to perform small tasks but hiring a intern for just small task will increase expenses so this app will allow company to hire particular person for short duration which will help in cost cutting.

Road Map : 
- Initialising github project.
- Creating Readme file with description.
- Creating low-fid design.
- Working with Front-end components.
- Working on Backend and routing.
- Authentication and Authorisation.
